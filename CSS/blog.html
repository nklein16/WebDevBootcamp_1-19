		<p>Anyone can paint. That's crazy. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.
		</p>

		<p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.
		</p>

		Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Son of a gun.

		Let's do that again. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Use what you see, don't plan it. There it is.

		A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Let the paint work.

		I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Just make a decision and let it go. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.
